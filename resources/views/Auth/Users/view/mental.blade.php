            Mental well-being refers to your cognitive and psychological health â€” how well your mind functions, how clearly you think, how well you can focus, and how capable you are of handling stress, solving problems, and making decisions. It's closely connected with emotional well-being, but focuses more on your mental processes and overall state of mind.
